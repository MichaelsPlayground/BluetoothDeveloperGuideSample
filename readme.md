# Bluetooth Developer guide sample

This app is oriented to Google's developer guide example code and allows to connect and chat 
with another Android device.

These are the steps for a successful communication

- step 1: check if the device has a Bluetooth sender/receiver chip
- step 2: grant the permissions that are needed to run the app
- step 3: check that Bluetooth is enabled on the device
- step 4: run the server to listen for incomming connection requests
- step 5: find devices nearby and make your device discoverable by other devices
- step 6: list found devices
- step 7: connect to a found device
- step 8: if the two devices were not coupled before ask the user to allow a connection
- step 9: when the devices are coupled and connected allow both users to send messages

Step 4 is done using the DeviceListActivity from the Bluetooth sample app and was slightly modificated 
for using within this app.

The UUID used for this app was generated by an online service: https://www.uuidgenerator.net/guid

The main source of this app is the developer guide found here: https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/connectivity/bluetooth

A (a little bit more complicated but better) sample app is available on Github:

These permissions need to be set in the AndroidManifest.xml:
```plaintext
<!-- Min/target SDK versions (<uses-sdk>) managed by build.gradle -->
    <!-- Request legacy Bluetooth permissions on older devices. -->
    <uses-permission
        android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH"
        android:maxSdkVersion="30" />
    <uses-permission
        android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_ADMIN"
        android:maxSdkVersion="30" />
    <!--
 Needed only if your app looks for Bluetooth devices.
         If your app doesn't use Bluetooth scan results to derive physical
         location information, you can strongly assert that your app
         doesn't derive physical location.
    -->
    <uses-permission
        android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_SCAN"
        android:usesPermissionFlags="neverForLocation"
        tools:targetApi="s" />
    <!--
 Needed only if your app makes the device discoverable to Bluetooth
         devices.
    -->
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_ADVERTISE" />
    <!--
 Needed only if your app communicates with already-paired Bluetooth
         devices.
    -->
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_CONNECT" /> <!-- Needed only if your app uses Bluetooth scan results to derive physical location. -->
    <uses-permission
        android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"
        tools:ignore="CoarseFineLocation" />
```
